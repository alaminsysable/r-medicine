# roro_medicine_reminder

It is a Final Year Project which I have done for my Bachelor’s Degree. The purpose of the mobile app is to help patients to help keep track or manage health-related routines like appointments & reminders to take in medicines. It uses Google Flutter framework with Google Firebase backend service & Dart object-oriented language.
